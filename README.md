## Validation

[PEP8 Validation Service](http://pep8online.com/) was used to check the code for PEP8 requirements. All the code passes with no errors and no warnings to show.

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| When selecting 'go back to main menu' option after the game has finished, the game title was not displayed | Move the function to the correct place |
| Console clear command was clearing all the content needed to display the board | Move the clear console method to correct identation
| Undefined player name was causing game to crash on email signup | Refactor code to allow the players to sign up seperately
| There were quite a few errors and warnings related to exceeded number of characters in line, whitespace within a blank line, trailing white spaces or missing white spaces around operators | Split the comments or print functions into two separate rows maintaining correct indentation. Followed a guidance within pep8 online tool and corrected all warnings and errors |

## Deployment
The website was deployed to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/) using the following process:
1. Login or create an account at [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku1.png">
1. Click on New > Create new app in the top right of the screen.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku2.png">
1. Add an app name and select location, then click 'create app'.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku3.png">
1. Under the deploy tab of the next page, select connect to GitHub.
1. Log in to your GitHub account when prompted.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku4.png">
1. Select the repository that you want to be connected to the Heroku app.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku5.png">
1. Click on the settings tab.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku6.png">
1. Scroll down to the config vars section, and add 2 config vars:
    * The first key is CREDS and the value here is the creds.json file that was generated for the google sheets API to work properly.
    * The second key is PORT and the Value is 8000
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku7.png">
1. Once you have set up the config vars, scroll down to buildpacks (still under the settings tab)
1. Add the Python and Node.js buildpacks to your app and make sure that when they are displayed, they appear in the order:
    * Python
    * Node.JS
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku8.png">
1. Navigate back to the settings tab.
1. Select automatic deploys to allow Heroku to build the site with new changes each time changes are pushed to GitHub.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku9.png">
1. In the 'manual deploy' section beneath this, make sure the branch selected is 'main' and click deploy branch.
<img src="docs/heroku/heroku10.png">
1. The site should now be built and Heroku should provide a url for the built site.
